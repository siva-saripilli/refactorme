# refactorme
This comprises of some badly written code and some unit test. The objective is to refactor the code and keep the tests passing.

Create a branch, refactor the ProcessPayment method on the InvoicePaymentProcessor.cs class then let us know once you are happy with the result so we can take a look at your branch.
The aim is to simplify and make the code more readable.
